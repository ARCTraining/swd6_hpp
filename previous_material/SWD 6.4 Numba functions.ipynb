They support array broadcasting, type casting, and several other standard features.\n","\n","A ufunc is a “vectorised” wrapper for a function that takes a fixed number of scalar inputs and produces a fixed number of scalar outputs.\n","\n","The @vectorize decorator has two modes of operation:\n","\n","* **Eager**, or decoration-time, compilation. If you pass one or more type signatures to the decorator, you will be building a Numpy ufunc. We're just going to consider eager compilation here.\n","* **Lazy**, or call-time, compilation. When not given any signatures, the decorator will give you a Numba dynamic universal function (DUFunc) that dynamically compiles a new kernel when called with a previously unsupported input type.\n","\n","Using `@vectorize`, you write your function as operating over input scalars, rather than arrays.
